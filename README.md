## What is Date Tracker? 🗓️
Date Tracker is a simple web app that helps you find out how much time is left between two dates. You can set a start date and an end date, choose how you want to see the results, and see the countdown!

## How to Use It 🛠️

### Setting Dates 📅
1. Enter your **start date** and **end date** using the date pickers.
2. You can quickly set default dates or use today’s date:
   - **Set Default Start Date**: Resets to August 18, 2024.
   - **Set Today as Start Date**: Uses the current date.
   - **Set Default End Date**: Resets to November 17, 2024.
   - **Set Today as End Date**: Uses the current date.

### Choosing the Result Format 🔄
You can select how you want the time difference shown:
- Weeks
- Months
- Years
- Days
- Days/Weeks
- Days/Months
- Days/Years
- Days/Months/Years

### Checking Time Remaining ⏳
The app will keep updating to show how much time is left until the end date. If the end date has passed, it will say "Time is up!"

## Using URL Parameters 🌐
You can also set dates using a URL! Here’s how:

- **start**: Your starting date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **end**: Your ending date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **format**: How you want to see the result (e.g., `weeks`, `months`, `days`).

### Example Links 🔗
To set the start date as January 1, 2024, and the end date as December 31, 2024, use this link:
```
https://eny.sa/tools/date-tracker?start=2024-01-01&end=2024-12-31&format=months
```
> To set the start date as January 3, 2020, and display the result in days / months / years, your URL would look like this:
```
https://eny.sa/tools/date-tracker?start=2020-01-03&format=daysMonthsYears
```
