## Overview
The Date Tracker is a web application that allows users to calculate the time difference between two dates. Users can set a start and end date, choose a format for the result, and view the time remaining until the end date.

## Usage
### Setting Dates
1. **Set the Start Date**: Use the date input field to select your start date.
2. **Set the End Date**: Use the date input field to select your end date.
3. **Quick Set Buttons**:
   - **Set Default Start Date**: Resets the start date to August 18, 2024.
   - **Set Today as Start Date**: Sets the start date to the current date.
   - **Set Default End Date**: Resets the end date to November 17, 2024.
   - **Set Today as End Date**: Sets the end date to the current date.

### Selecting Result Format
Choose how you want the difference between the two dates to be displayed using the dropdown menu. The options include:
- 📅 Weeks
- 📅 Months
- 📅 Years
- 📅 Days
- 📅 Days/Weeks
- 📅 Days/Months
- 📅 Days/Years
- 📅 Days/Months/Years

### Calculating Time Remaining
The application continuously updates to show how much time remains until the end date. If the end date has passed, it will display "Time is up!"

## URL Query Parameters
The Date Tracker supports the following URL query parameters for pre-setting the start and end dates, as well as the result format:

- `start`: The start date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- `end`: The end date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- `format`: The desired result format (`weeks`, `months`, `years`, `days`, `daysWeeks`, `daysMonths`, `daysYears`, `daysMonthsYears`).

### Example Usage 💡
To set the start date as January 1, 2024, the end date as December 31, 2024, and display the result in months, your URL would look like this:
```
https://eny.sa/tools/date-tracker?start=2024-01-01&end=2024-12-31&format=months
```
To set the start date as January 3, 2020, and display the result in days / months / years, your URL would look like this:
```
https://eny.sa/tools/date-tracker?start=2020-01-03&format=daysMonthsYears
```
